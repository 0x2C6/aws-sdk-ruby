    "CreateStream": "<p>This operation adds a new Amazon Kinesis stream to your AWS account. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or <i>producers</i>. Scale-out within an Amazon Kinesis stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in an Amazon Kinesis stream.</p> <p>You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each open shard can support up to 5 read transactions per second, up to a maximum total of 2 MB of data read per second. Each shard can support up to 1000 write transactions per second, up to a maximum total of 1 MB data written per second. You can add shards to a stream if the amount of data input increases and you can remove shards if the amount of data input decreases.</p> <p>The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application. It is also scoped by region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different regions, can have the same name. </p> <p><code>CreateStream</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>CreateStream</code> request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns and sets the stream status to CREATING. After the stream is created, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream status to ACTIVE. You should perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE stream. </p> <p>You receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code> when making a <code>CreateStream</code> request if you try to do one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Have more than five streams in the CREATING state at any point in time.</li> <li>Create more shards than are authorized for your account.</li> </ul> <p><b>Note:</b> The default limit for an AWS account is 10 shards per stream. If you need to create a stream with more than 10 shards, <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html\">contact AWS Support</a> to increase the limit on your account.</p> <p>You can use the <code>DescribeStream</code> operation to check the stream status, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.</p> <p><code>CreateStream</code> has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account.</p>",
    "DeleteStream": "<p>This operation deletes a stream and all of its shards and data. You must shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete the stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it will receive the exception <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>.</p> <p>If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can delete it. After a <code>DeleteStream</code> request, the specified stream is in the DELETING state until Amazon Kinesis completes the deletion.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Amazon Kinesis might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as <a>PutRecord</a> and <a>GetRecords</a>, on a stream in the DELETING state until the stream deletion is complete.</p> <p>When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted.</p> <p>You can use the <a>DescribeStream</a> operation to check the state of the stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.</p> <p><code>DeleteStream</code> has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account.</p>",
    "DescribeStream": "<p>This operation returns the following information about the stream: the current status of the stream, the stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and an array of shard objects that comprise the stream. For each shard object there is information about the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in a <a>MergeShards</a> or <a>SplitShard</a> operation that created the shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the Amazon Kinesis stream. The sequence number is assigned by the Amazon Kinesis service when a record is put into the stream. </p> <p>You can limit the number of returned shards using the <code>Limit</code> parameter. The number of shards in a stream may be too large to return from a single call to <code>DescribeStream</code>. You can detect this by using the <code>HasMoreShards</code> flag in the returned output. <code>HasMoreShards</code> is set to <code>true</code> when there is more data available. </p> <p>If there are more shards available, you can request more shards by using the shard ID of the last shard returned by the <code>DescribeStream</code> request, in the <code>ExclusiveStartShardId</code> parameter in a subsequent request to <code>DescribeStream</code>. <code>DescribeStream</code> is a paginated operation. </p> <p><code>DescribeStream</code> has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.</p>",
    "GetRecords": "<p>This operation returns one or more data records from a shard. A <code>GetRecords</code> operation request can retrieve up to 10 MB of data.</p> <p>You specify a shard iterator for the shard that you want to read data from in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. A shard iterator specifies this position using the sequence number of a data record in the shard. For more information about the shard iterator, see <a>GetShardIterator</a>.</p> <p><code>GetRecords</code> may return a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded. You will get an error, but not a partial result if the shard's provisioned throughput is exceeded, the shard iterator has expired, or an internal processing failure has occurred. Clients can request a smaller amount of data by specifying a maximum number of returned records using the <code>Limit</code> parameter. The <code>Limit</code> parameter can be set to an integer value of up to 10,000. If you set the value to an integer greater than 10,000, you will receive <code>InvalidArgumentException</code>.</p> <p>A new shard iterator is returned by every <code>GetRecords</code> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <code>GetRecords</code> request. When you repeatedly read from an Amazon Kinesis stream use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get the first shard iterator to use in your first <code>GetRecords</code> request and then use the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> for subsequent reads.</p> <p><code>GetRecords</code> can return <code>null</code> for the <code>NextShardIterator</code> to reflect that the shard has been closed and that the requested shard iterator would never have returned more data. </p> <p>If no items can be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, <code>GetRecords</code> throws <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.</p>",
    "GetShardIterator": "<p>This operation returns a shard iterator in <code>ShardIterator</code>. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. A shard iterator specifies this position using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the Amazon Kinesis stream. The sequence number is assigned by the Amazon Kinesis service when a record is put into the stream. </p> <p>You must specify the shard iterator type in the <code>GetShardIterator</code> request. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code> parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type, or right after the sequence number by using the AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>GetRecords</a> or <a>DescribeStream</a> requests. You can specify the shard iterator type TRIM_HORIZON in the request to cause <code>ShardIterator</code> to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system, which is the oldest data record in the shard. Or you can point to just after the most recent record in the shard, by using the shard iterator type LATEST, so that you always read the most recent data in the shard. </p> <p><b>Note:</b> Each shard iterator expires five minutes after it is returned to the requester.</p> <p>When you repeatedly read from an Amazon Kinesis stream use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get the first shard iterator to to use in your first <code>GetRecords</code> request and then use the shard iterator returned by the <code>GetRecords</code> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code> for subsequent reads. A new shard iterator is returned by every <code>GetRecords</code> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <code>GetRecords</code> request. </p> <p>If a <code>GetShardIterator</code> request is made too often, you will receive a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. For more information about throughput limits, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/\">Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</a>. </p> <p><code>GetShardIterator</code> can return <code>null</code> for its <code>ShardIterator</code> to indicate that the shard has been closed and that the requested iterator will return no more data. A shard can be closed by a <a>SplitShard</a> or <a>MergeShards</a> operation.</p> <p><code>GetShardIterator</code> has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account per open shard.</p>",
    "ListStreams": "<p> This operation returns an array of the names of all the streams that are associated with the AWS account making the <code>ListStreams</code> request. A given AWS account can have many streams active at one time. </p> <p> The number of streams may be too large to return from a single call to <code>ListStreams</code>. You can limit the number of returned streams using the <code>Limit</code> parameter. If you do not specify a value for the <code>Limit</code> parameter, Amazon Kinesis uses the default limit, which is currently 10.</p> <p> You can detect if there are more streams available to list by using the <code>HasMoreStreams</code> flag from the returned output. If there are more streams available, you can request more streams by using the name of the last stream returned by the <code>ListStreams</code> request in the <code>ExclusiveStartStreamName</code> parameter in a subsequent request to <code>ListStreams</code>. The group of stream names returned by the subsequent request is then added to the list. You can continue this process until all the stream names have been collected in the list. </p> <p><code>ListStreams</code> has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account.</p>",
    "MergeShards": "<p>This operation merges two adjacent shards in a stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.</p> <p><code>MergeShards</code> is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. The operation requires that you specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a given stream. For more information about merging shards, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/\">Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call <code>MergeShards</code>. If a stream is in CREATING or UPDATING or DELETING states, then Amazon Kinesis returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If the specified stream does not exist, Amazon Kinesis returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. </p> <p>You can use the <a>DescribeStream</a> operation to check the state of the stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.</p> <p><code>MergeShards</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>MergeShards</code> request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns a response and sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to UPDATING. After the operation is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to ACTIVE. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state. </p> <p>You use the <a>DescribeStream</a> operation to determine the shard IDs that are specified in the <code>MergeShards</code> request. </p> <p>If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using <a>CreateStream</a>, <a>DeleteStream</a>, <code>MergeShards</code> or <a>SplitShard</a>, you will receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code>. </p> <p><code>MergeShards</code> has limit of 5 transactions per second per account.</p>",
    "PutRecord": "<p>This operation puts a data record into an Amazon Kinesis stream from a producer. This operation must be called to send data from the producer into the Amazon Kinesis stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing. The <code>PutRecord</code> operation requires the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The data blob could be a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, or any other data type.</p> <p>The partition key is used to distribute data across shards. Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a data stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to. </p> <p>Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 bytes. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/\">Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p><code>PutRecord</code> returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record.</p> <p>Sequence numbers generally increase over time. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, use the <code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code> parameter. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/\">Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>If a <code>PutRecord</code> request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, <code>PutRecord</code> throws <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. </p> <p>Data records are accessible for only 24 hours from the time that they are added to an Amazon Kinesis stream.</p>",
    "SplitShard": "<p>This operation splits a shard into two new shards in the stream, to increase the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. <code>SplitShard</code> is called when there is a need to increase the overall capacity of stream because of an expected increase in the volume of data records being ingested. </p> <p><code>SplitShard</code> can also be used when a given shard appears to be approaching its maximum utilization, for example, when the set of producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call the <code>SplitShard</code> operation to increase stream capacity, so that more Amazon Kinesis applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time processing. </p> <p>The <code>SplitShard</code> operation requires that you specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might simply be the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the shard. For more information about splitting shards, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/\">Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</a>. </p> <p>You can use the <a>DescribeStream</a> operation to determine the shard ID and hash key values for the <code>ShardToSplit</code> and <code>NewStartingHashKey</code> parameters that are specified in the <code>SplitShard</code> request.</p> <p><code>SplitShard</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>SplitShard</code> request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns a response and sets the stream status to UPDATING. After the operation is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream status to ACTIVE. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state. </p> <p>You can use <code>DescribeStream</code> to check the status of the stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.
