  "documentation": "<p>Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for \"cold data.\"</p> <p>Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</p> <p>Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>.</p> <p>You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier. </p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the <i>Amazon Glacier Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html\">What is Amazon Glacier</a> - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html\">Getting Started with Amazon Glacier</a> - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.</p></li> </ul>",

After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Amazon Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.</p> <p>In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html\">Computing Checksums</a>. On the server side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.</p> <p>Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon Glacier returns an error and the operation fails. </p> <p>Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.</p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).

For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You use the following process to download the job output:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range using the <code>Range</code> header.</p> </li> <li> <p>Along with the data, the response includes a checksum of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.</p> </li> <li> <p>After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the Describe Job API, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.</p> </li> </ol> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).

To determine when a job is complete, you have the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Use Amazon SNS Notification</b> You can specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon Glacier can post a notification after the job is completed. You can specify an SNS topic per job request. The notification is sent only after Amazon Glacier completes the job. In addition to specifying an SNS topic per job request, you can configure vault notifications for a vault so that job notifications are always sent. For more information, see SetVaultNotificationConfiguration.</p> </li> <li> <p><b>Get job details</b> You can make a DescribeJob request to obtain job status information while a job is in progress. However, it is more efficient to use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is complete.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The information you get via notification is same that you get by calling DescribeJob.</p> <p>If for a specific event, you add both the notification configuration on the vault and also specify an SNS topic in your initiate job request, Amazon Glacier sends both notifications.

When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data you get might be up to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download the vault inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory for each vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find the vault inventory useful. For example, when you upload an archive, you can provide an archive description but not an archive name. Amazon Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque string of characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive names to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile information in your database with the actual vault inventory. </p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
