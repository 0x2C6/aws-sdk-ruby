Treating decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform conceptual model and helps keep policies readable. For details and example IAM policies, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html\">Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows</a>.</p> <p><b>Decision Failure</b></p> <p>Decisions can fail for several reasons</p> <ul> <li>The ordering of decisions should follow a logical flow. Some decisions might not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and will therefore fail.</li> <li>A limit on your account was reached.</li> <li>The decision lacks sufficient permissions.</li> </ul> <p>One of the following events might be added to the history to indicate an error. The event attribute's <b>cause</b> parameter indicates the cause. If <b>cause</b> is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED, the decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. </p> <ul> <li> <b>ScheduleActivityTaskFailed</b> a ScheduleActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision is not registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision is not properly configured.</li> <li> <b>RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed</b> a RequestCancelActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.</li> <li> <b>StartTimerFailed</b> a StartTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.</li> <li> <b>CancelTimerFailed</b> a CancelTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.</li> <li> <b>StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a StartChildWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified is not registered, is deprecated, or the decision is not properly configured.</li> <li> <b>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a SignalExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the <code>workflowID</code> specified in the decision was incorrect. </li> <li> <b>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the <code>workflowID</code> specified in the decision was incorrect. </li> <li> <b>CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a CancelWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. </li> <li> <b>CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a CompleteWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. </li> <li> <b>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not configured correctly. </li> <li> <b>FailWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a FailWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. </li> </ul> <p> The preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error. </p> <p><b>How to Code a Decision</b></p> <p> You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below: </p> <ul> <li><a>ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>StartTimerDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>CancelTimerDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> <li><a>StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a></li> </ul>",
