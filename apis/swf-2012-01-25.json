After a worker receives an activity task from Amazon SWF, it performs the task and responds using <a href=\"API_RespondActivityTaskCompleted.html\" title=\"RespondActivityTaskCompleted\">RespondActivityTaskCompleted</a> if successful or <a href=\"API_RespondActivityTaskFailed.html\" title=\"RespondActivityTaskFailed\">RespondActivityTaskFailed</a> if unsuccessful. </p> <p><b>Actions related to Deciders</b></p> <p>The following are actions that are performed by deciders:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_PollForDecisionTask.html\" title=\"PollForDecisionTask\">PollForDecisionTask</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_RespondDecisionTaskCompleted.html\" title=\"RespondDecisionTaskCompleted\">RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Deciders use <a href=\"API_PollForDecisionTask.html\" title=\"PollForDecisionTask\">PollForDecisionTask</a> to get decision tasks. After a decider receives a decision task from Amazon SWF, it examines its workflow execution history and decides what to do next. It calls <a href=\"API_RespondDecisionTaskCompleted.html\" title=\"RespondDecisionTaskCompleted\">RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</a>to complete the decision task and provide zero or more next decisions. </p> <p><b>Actions related to Workflow Executions</b></p> <p>The following actions operate on a workflow execution:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_RequestCancelWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"RequestCancelWorkflowExecution\">RequestCancelWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_StartWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"StartWorkflowExecution\">StartWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_SignalWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"SignalWorkflowExecution\">SignalWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_TerminateWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"TerminateWorkflowExecution\">TerminateWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Actions related to Administration</b></p> <p>Although you can perform administrative tasks from the Amazon SWF console, you can use the actions in this section to automate functions or build your own administrative tools. </p> <p><b>Activity Management</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_RegisterActivityType.html\" title=\"RegisterActivityType\">RegisterActivityType</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DeprecateActivityType.html\" title=\"DeprecateActivityType\">DeprecateActivityType</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Workflow Management</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_RegisterWorkflowType.html\" title=\"RegisterWorkflowType\">RegisterWorkflowType</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DeprecateWorkflowType.html\" title=\"DeprecateWorkflowType\">DeprecateWorkflowType</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Domain Management</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_RegisterDomain.html\" title=\"RegisterDomain\">RegisterDomain</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DeprecateDomain.html\" title=\"DeprecateDomain\">DeprecateDomain</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Workflow Execution Management</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_RequestCancelWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"RequestCancelWorkflowExecution\">RequestCancelWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_TerminateWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"TerminateWorkflowExecution\">TerminateWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Visibility Actions</b></p> <p>Although you can perform visibility actions from the Amazon SWF console, you can use the actions in this section to build your own console or administrative tools. </p> <ul> </ul> <p><b>Activity Visibility</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_ListActivityTypes.html\" title=\"ListActivities\">ListActivityTypes</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DescribeActivityType.html\" title=\"DescribeActivityType\">DescribeActivity</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Workflow Visibility</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_ListWorkflowTypes.html\" title=\"ListWorkflowTypes\">ListWorkflowTypes</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DescribeWorkflowType.html\" title=\"DescribeWorkflowType\">DescribeWorkflowType</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Workflow Execution Visibility</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DescribeWorkflowExecution.html\" title=\"DescribeWorkflowExecution\">DescribeWorkflowExecution</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_ListOpenWorkflowExecutions.html\" title=\"ListOpenWorkflowExecutions\">ListOpenWorkflowExecutions</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_ListClosedWorkflowExecutions.html\" title=\"ListClosedWorkflowExecutions\">ListClosedWorkflowExecutions</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_CountOpenWorkflowExecutions.html\" title=\"CountOpenWorkflowExecutions\">CountOpenWorkflowExecutions</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions.html\" title=\"CountClosedWorkflowExecutions\">CountClosedWorkflowExecutions</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_GetWorkflowExecutionHistory.html\" title=\"GetWorkflowExecutionHistory\">GetWorkflowExecutionHistory</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Domain Visibility</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_ListDomains.html\" title=\"ListDomains\">ListDomains</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_DescribeDomain.html\" title=\"DescribeDomain\">DescribeDomain</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Task List Visibility</b></p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_CountPendingActivityTasks.html\" title=\"CountPendingActivityTasks\">CountPendingActivityTasks</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"API_CountPendingDecisionTasks.html\" title=\"CountPendingDecisionTasks\">CountPendingDecisionTasks</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

This timer will fire after the specified delay and record a <code>TimerFired</code> event.</li> </ul> <p><b>Access Control</b></p> <p>If you grant permission to use <code>RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</code>, you can use IAM policies to express permissions for the list of decisions returned by this action as if they were members of the API. Treating decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform conceptual model and helps keep policies readable. For details and example IAM policies, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html\">Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows</a>.</p> <p><b>Decision Failure</b></p> <p>Decisions can fail for several reasons</p> <ul> <li>The ordering of decisions should follow a logical flow. Some decisions might not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and will therefore fail.</li> <li>A limit on your account was reached.</li> <li>The decision lacks sufficient permissions.</li> </ul> <p>One of the following events might be added to the history to indicate an error. The event attribute's <b>cause</b> parameter indicates the cause. If <b>cause</b> is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED, the decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. </p> <ul> <li> <b>ScheduleActivityTaskFailed</b> a ScheduleActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision is not registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision is not properly configured.</li> <li> <b>RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed</b> a RequestCancelActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.</li> <li> <b>StartTimerFailed</b> a StartTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.</li> <li> <b>CancelTimerFailed</b> a CancelTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.</li> <li> <b>StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a StartChildWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified is not registered, is deprecated, or the decision is not properly configured.</li> <li> <b>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a SignalExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the <code>workflowID</code> specified in the decision was incorrect. </li> <li> <b>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the <code>workflowID</code> specified in the decision was incorrect. </li> <li> <b>CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a CancelWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. </li> <li> <b>CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a CompleteWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. </li> <li> <b>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not configured correctly. </li> <li> <b>FailWorkflowExecutionFailed</b> a FailWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. </li> </ul> <p> The preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error. </p> A workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of the following decisions when completing a decision task: <code>CompleteWorkflowExecution</code>, <code>FailWorkflowExecution</code>, <code>CancelWorkflowExecution</code> and <code>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution</code>. An UnhandledDecision fault will be returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution. <p><b>How to Code a Decision</b></p> <p> You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below: </p> <ul> <li>ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</li> <li>RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</li> <li>CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> <li>FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> <li>CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> <li>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> <li>RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes</li> <li>StartTimerDecisionAttributes</li> <li>CancelTimerDecisionAttributes</li> <li>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> <li>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> <li>StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</li> </ul>",
