# TODO

* Implement support for resource collection batch actions. Currently, the
  generated methods are non-functional.

* `Aws::S3::Client` had previously modified the API model prior to generating
   API documentation that added an `:accelerate` option to all but three options.
   We are no longer generating docs in a separate pass of the models. Leaving
   these customizations makes them valid request parameters.

   We need to consider how to re-apply these options to documentation.

   * Add them to the model, and remove the values prior to serialization.
     This has the side-effect of making them members in the generated types.

   * Write a documentation plugin to document the option, but not modify
     the api. This becomes extra code to support. We'd like to eliminate
     all docuemntation plugins if possible.
