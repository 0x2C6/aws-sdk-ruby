* Feature - `Aws::S3::Client` - Enabling url-encoding of Amazon S3 keys by default.
  Keys are decoded before response data is returned. See [#95](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/95).

* Feature - `Aws::ElasticLoadBalancing::Client` - Added support for the new tagging
  operations.

* Feature - `Aws::CloudSearch::Client` - Will now sign requests when credentials
  are provided. You can continue making unauthenticated requests if you do not
  configure credentials to the client.

* Feature - Coverage - Now generating coverage reports during Travis builds
  and reporting via Coveralls.io.

* Upgrading - `Aws::DynamoDB::Client` - Added a plugin that simplifies working
  with DynamoDB attribute values. Enabled by default, to restore default
  behavior, use `:simple_attributes => false`.

* Issue - Documentation - Now loading API files with UTF-8 encoding.
  See [#92](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/92).

2.0.0.rc14 (2014-08-05)

* Upgrading - Client Classes - Versioned client classes removed, e.g.
  `Aws::S3::Client::V20060301.new` is now `Aws::S3::Client.new` The
  `:api_version` constructor option is no longer accepted.

* Upgrading - `Aws` Module - Helper methods on `Aws` for client classes
  deprecated; For example, calling `Aws.s3` will generate a deprecation
  warning. Use `Aws::S3::Client.new` instead. Helpers will be removed as
  of v2.0.0 final.

* Upgrading - Conig - When configuring an `:endpoint`, you must now specify
  the HTTP scheme, e.g. "http://localhost:3000", instead of "localhost:3000".
